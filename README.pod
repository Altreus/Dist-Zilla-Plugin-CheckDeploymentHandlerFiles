=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckDeploymentHandlerFiles - Check you've created the DH files for this version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    [CheckDeploymentHandlerFiles]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you have a schema that uses L<DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler> then your
deployment will bail if you don't have a directory for migrating to the current
version. If your schema is part of a wider module it's fairly likely that you'll
forget to create these files because you didn't do any work on the schema.

This plugin simply bails if there's no C<x-y> directory where DH would normally
put them.

=head1 TODO

Configuration so that the user can replicate any customisation of
DeploymentHandler, thus searching for the correct directory.

=head1 BUGS

Report any issues on the github bugtracker.
